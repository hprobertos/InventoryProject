# InventoryProject
Visual Basic/SQL Server school project

I do not earn money from this and the only purpose of it was to complete the corresponding course.

## How to use
ItÂ´s a simulation of an inventory of a warehouse, where you can add items, delete, make a purchase and get a receipt. 

You have all rights to use it as you wish, but I will be so grateful if you credit me for my hard work.
